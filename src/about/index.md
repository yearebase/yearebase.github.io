## Who is Tadeáš Souček? [[#me]]

Frankly, I have no idea. I usually describe myself as a programmer first and foremost, though I do other stuff as well.

## Why ‘Ye Are Base’? [[#name]]

It’s a line from Voltairine de Cleyre’s 1891 poem [_Bastard Born_](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/voltairine-de-cleyre-bastard-born):

<blockquote>
  {% poem %}
    {% stanza %}
      {% l %} Basely born! ’Tis <strong>ye are base!</strong> {% endl %}
      {% l %} Ye who would guerdon holy trust {% endl %}
      {% l %} With slavish law to a tyrant race, {% endl %}
      {% l %} To sow the earth with the seed of lust. {% endl %}
    {% endstanza %}
  {% endpoem %}
</blockquote>

## Why this design? [[#design]]

Some history: the precursor to this website was supposed to be my personal blog, which was *supposed* to be the peak of my web dev skills. I grew bored of it eventually and put off having any sort of website for a time. Then, I came across [NeoCities](https://neocities.org) and the communities of the old web like [YesterWeb](https://yesterweb.org), and that revived my interest. Eventually I decided on the name (see [above](#name) as to the reason why), created a basic skeleton and put it online.

The design was originally a minimalist gray-and-white blog, but I wasn’t very fond of it, so I decided to change the design to something else. Something sillier, something goofier and more relaxed, more in-line with the old web. And the way I went about this was… to change the colour scheme from ‘white on dark gray’ to ‘black on light pink on light blue,’ which, plainly, didn’t look good. Eventually I created this system, with the themes being very silly indeed and changing from section to section. I do have to admit that it’s not the prettiest, but I still kind of like it. Tbh, I’ve grown vaguely dissatisfied with the modern trend of minimalist designs with big, bold, geometric typefaces and punchy primary colours. They look good, don’t get me wrong, but they do begin to feel a bit samey.

## What’s in store? [[#future]]

I plan on putting this site on the [YesterWeb webring](https://yesterweb.org/webring/), but I have to add more stuff first. Also, I’ll probably add an updates section.

Another thing I’ve thought of is putting a recommendation section in here somewhere. That would be of no use to anybody, but would allow me to get it out of my system.

## What about the licence? [[#licence]]
