## Who is Tadeáš Souček? [[#me]]

Frankly, I have no idea. I usually describe myself as a programmer first and foremost, though I do other stuff as well.

## Why ‘Ye Are Base’? [[#name]]

It’s a line from Voltairine de Cleyre’s 1891 poem [_Bastard Born_](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/voltairine-de-cleyre-bastard-born):

<blockquote>
  {% poem %}
    {% stanza %}
      {% l %} Basely born! ’Tis <strong>ye are base!</strong> {% endl %}
      {% l %} Ye who would guerdon holy trust {% endl %}
      {% l %} With slavish law to a tyrant race, {% endl %}
      {% l %} To sow the earth with the seed of lust. {% endl %}
    {% endstanza %}
  {% endpoem %}
</blockquote>
