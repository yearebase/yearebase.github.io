# {{ title }}

This website was created and is operated by [Tadeáš Souček](https://github.com/tadeassoucek). Address any concerns or questions to [yearebase@gmail.com](mailto:yearebase@gmail.com).

## Who is Tadeáš Souček? [[#me]]

Frankly, I have no idea. I usually describe myself as a programmer first and foremost, though I do other stuff as well.

## Why ‘Ye Are Base’? [[#name]]

It’s a line from Voltairine de Cleyre’s 1891 poem [_Bastard Born_](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/voltairine-de-cleyre-bastard-born):

<blockquote>
  {% poem %}
    {% stanza %}
      {% l %} Basely born! ’Tis <strong>ye are base!</strong> {% endl %}
      {% l %} Ye who would guerdon holy trust {% endl %}
      {% l %} With slavish law to a tyrant race, {% endl %}
      {% l %} To sow the earth with the seed of lust. {% endl %}
    {% endstanza %}
  {% endpoem %}
</blockquote>

## What’s in store? [[#future]]

I plan on putting this site on the [YesterWeb webring](https://yesterweb.org/webring/), but I have to add more stuff first. Also, I’ll probably add an updates section.

Another thing I’ve thought of is putting a recommendation section in here somewhere. That would be of no use to anybody, but would allow me to get it out of my system.

## What about the licence? [[#licence]]

All of the code powering this website is available [online](https://github.com/yearebase/yearebase.github.io) and licenced under the MIT licence, meaning you can do pretty much anything with it.

That means you can use any of it anywhere else, even for commercially, and modify it to your heart’s content, provided you attribute the original to me.
